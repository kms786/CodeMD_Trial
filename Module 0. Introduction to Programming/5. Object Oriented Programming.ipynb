    "## Functional vs. Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "- Most programming you have done up to now is functional.\n",
    "- In simple terms, this is putting inputs into a function, getting an output and then using that output as the input to another function.\n",
    "- In many cases our code can be more neatly organised on a conceptual level by grouping related functions together into what we call a 'class'.\n",
    "- A class is a collection of 'data' which we call attributes, and 'functions' which we call methods.\n",
    "- A single instance of a class is called an 'object' and the act of its creation is called 'instantiation'.\n",
    "- To reiterate, a method is a function associated with an object, and that association is the fact they are part of the same class.\n",
    "- This means we can much more easily handle doing tasks repeatedly for similar types of data, in the same way that we use loops/functions etc."

    "To understand this idea, it is best to use an example:\n",
    "- Imagine you owned a shop, and wanted an easy way to keep stock of everything you have in it.\n",
    "- You could create a StockItem class, with characteristics of the items such as the name of the item, how many you have in stock, the price of each item, which section the item is in etc.\n",
    "- You could also have operations that the items could 'do', e.g. take delivery, sell an item, change its price etc. <br>\n",
    "    1. A __CLASS__ defines a blueprint of an item. By itself, it doesn't hold any data - rather it is defining the structure of how __OBJECTS__ which use that class would look.\n",
    "    2. An __OBJECT__ is __INSTANTIATED__ from a class. Here, we pass in the values we want our object to be populated with. In the case of the class StockItem, our object could have a name of \"banana\", with a price of 0.25 and a stock level of 10.\n",
    "    3. Any operations we want to perform on the object, for example, changing the stock level, would be done through a __METHOD__. A method is simply a function attached to a class.\n",
    "    4. The actual characteristics of the item, such as the name, stock level and price are known as __ATTRIBUTES__."

    "Now let's break down the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Definition\n",
    "1. class keyword: indicates creation of class.\n",
    "2. ClassName: use PascalCase (no spaces, capitalised words) for naming classes, snake_case for functions/variables.\n",
    "3. Parentheses/colon: do not need parentheses, but add as a matter of style, add colon to end statement and indicate indent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Constructor\n",
    "4. \\_\\_init\\_\\_ is the first 'method' in the class, named the class constructor. This is called automatically when instance of class created. Note the 'def' keyword is the same as functions, and it has parameters like functions, BUT it is a __METHOD__.\n",
    "5. The first argument for \\_\\_init\\_\\_ is 'self' by convention, this is used to refer to each instance of a class (how Python distinguishes one instance of a class from another).\n",
    "6. The arguments for \\_\\_init\\_\\_ define the inputs assigned to each class instance.\n",
    "7. Can define defaults for these parameters e.g. param2 = 1, BUT default arguments cannot be followed by non-default arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "8. Attributes are assigned using \\_\\_init\\_\\_ parameters with the self conventional keyword.\n",
    "9. Hence we use the syntax self.param = param to assign attributes.\n",
    "10. Attributes do not require () when called as they are not executable.\n",
    "11. We can define attributes using other attributes as shown with self.param3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods\n",
    "12. Methods are defined as functions within a class.\n",
    "13. They perform operations based on inputs as defined by attributes.\n",
    "14. Whether or not a method takes any external parameters, the first parameter of a method is always self.\n",
    "15. When referencing attributes, we must reference instance: self.param1, NOT param1.\n",
    "16. Methods can take external arguments such as ext_input: these must be specified when calling the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining Attributes using Methods\n",
    "17. We can have attributes that are not defined by parameters of \\_\\_init\\_\\_.\n",
    "18. These can be defined as being empty or zero for example.\n",
    "19. We can then define them later using a method.\n",
    "20. For example, some_other_method takes in ext_input1 and ext_input2 and uses them to define self.param4."
